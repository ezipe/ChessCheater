# ChessCheater
Main purpose of publication is for invitation of critique. Still highly buggy and unfinished, there're terrible programming practices all over this, so please criticize so that I can improve. Thank you in advance for any suggestions! 


WARNING-From a moral perspective, this project was only created as a means of learning more about frameworks, web automation, and scripting. This tool should not actually be used to artificially boost ELO on chess.com, which is essentially lying and immoral. 


Integration of stockfish, selenium, and python-chess to cheat on chess.com


Stockfish, selenium, and python-chess will need to be installed as dependencies, along with your respective webdriver(read selenium docs for more info)
https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://pypi.org/project/selenium/
https://stockfishchess.org/

Nothing much needs to be done except for running chess-automator.py, and assuming you're viewing this on a 1080p screen it should function perfectly. Fixes will be created for all monitors soon!
